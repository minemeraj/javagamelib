Todo:

1.  Apple extensions
2.  Pbuffers - means opening up some internals like HDC and HWNDs that are
    meaningless to other operating systems but who cares...
4.  Javadoc for GL commands. For now why not just paste in the OpenGL man
    docs in there as they're in the public domain? If anyone complains we'll
    just have to sort something else out...
5.  Change callback mechanism for GLUQuadrics to use an interface

6.  Pbuffers for linux (and maybe macosx) - it's possible afaik
9.  Mode switching when alt+tabbing from fullscreen - if possible.
11. OS X version
12. BSD Version?
13. Better documentation/tutorials
14. Better build system
15. 2D API
